[Paths]
;Always use full paths.

[Installation]
;Type of installation: "system" or "developer"
;System: Checkout to trunk, Build, install.
;developer: Checkout to trunk, build, install on same trunkDir (will not use installDir)
InstallType = system
;When installing using only the open source repository, set next option to True

;Clean actions before starting installation procedure. "Yes" or "No"
;The "NO" is mandatory, but the "Yes" still depends on other options.

;Clean actions after installation. "Yes" or "No"
;For system installation, removes trunk and build dir after installation
;For developer installation, removes build dir after the installation

;The templateProfileFile will also be always placed in root of installDir in a
; system installation or in the root of trunkDir in a developer installation as well as in the current dir

[Tests]
;Run the tests in test suite after install: Yes or No

;Script inside the tests directory to run
TestScript = runOpenTests.sh
;relative paths are related to the current install dir
LogFile = ./tests.log

;These envVars will be added to the TemplateProfileFile

;Do not use localVars within this section
;To use them in this setup file, place them between %% Ex: PYTHON = /usr/bin/python%PYTHON_VER%

[Advanced]
;Platform Type can be workstation or something else like for instance cluster if you want separate types of installations.
PlatformType = workstation
;include in the template profile the source of the files in the option "sources" (comma separated files) 
; Use just if needed. For example, when we need to load modules it might be needed to use the following option
;sources = /etc/profile.d/modules.csh

;If the optimizer tests are failing, it might be necessary this option
;gcc module to be used only when compiling appspack

[Dependencies]
;Syntax:  
;   DependencyName = FileURL|SVNURL[,VersionNumber|RevNumber][,*]
;
;If RevNum, in SVN cases, is not provided, the SVN HEAD will be used
;If dependency not specified or is empty, it will not use the dependency at all. 
;    It must be somehow already installed or being loaded by modules
;If the third argument * is present, the respective dependency will not be built and it will use a previous installed one.
;    It must already have been installed in a previous azorange full installation (without *)
