The C-level and the python API (created by SWIG) between the OpenCV random forest implementation and AZOrange 
consists of the following source files:
randomForest.cc
randomForest.h
randomForest.i     # Interface file for swig
swigit.sh          # Creates the randomForest.py module, which uses _randomForest.so
compile.sh         # Compiles the C-code into an executable

Example of how to run the randomForest executable:
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /opt/az/unsupported/azorange/orangeDependencies/opencv/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

./randomForest.exe ./Train.tab ./Train.RFmodel 10 104  20 1 false false 0 100 0.1 0
